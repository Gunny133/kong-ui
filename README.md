[Kong](https://getkong.org/about/) is a scalable, open source API Layer (also known as a API Gateway, or API Middleware). Kong comes with an internal RESTful API for administration purposes. API commands can be run on any node in the cluster, and Kong will keep the configuration consistent across all nodes.

KONG UI is a standalone UI app which connects to the REST API to admin KONG.


Project still under active development.
